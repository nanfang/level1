Xx is on the move.
The  answer is almost always No.
Can we talk about his cut backs?
Let me just put on hold
Where are you getting this information?
This is not worth our time.
He really does fit xxxx.
Maybe over some coffee later.
He is trying to set you up.
What is the square footage?
I pulled those pictures off the internet.
I see I've underestimated you.
 
S7E9
Sometimes you have to put up with policies you don't like.
Passive-aggressive.
How's everybody doing?
I've decided to open up a second round of investment.
I need you to figure this one out on your own.
I think you should make time for it.
Have some faith in this idea.
I think I agree with your point.
How far can you reach.
Thanks so much for having my back out here.
There don't seem to be any consequences.
That's a lot of pressure.
I won't let you down.
You just have to play with the cards that you're dealt.
 
 
 
S7E8
I am joking, I'm kidding around.
Welcome to my man cave.
I'll just turn the captions on.
per se
You are making this harder than it has to be.
Something is coming up, I have to go.
Are you having a good time?
I'll see what I can find out.
I'm gonna give it a shot.
Are you authorized to do this?
 
S7E7
By that rationale, xxx
I wish you both a pleasant day.
scooch over
Oh, I insist, after you.
I think we should hang out more together.
This is irresponsible.
It’s superb.
Can I authorize a 15% discount?
I won't stand for it.
Just heads up, xxxx
I have my eye on you
I saw a sign for scenic overlook coming up, really love to check out the view.
Can's stop , we are on a schedule.
I bet.
 
S7E6
You should have gotten credit for that.
You are all on the list.
We are going to straighten this out.
I'm a little peeved at xxx right now.
Well, I'm sorry if  it seems that way to you.
I know how to sit on a fence.
You are gonna miss out on some good ideas.
If they are really good ideas, my door is open to that.
I am not budging on xxx
We both reserve the right to go to xxxx
I have tallied the votes.
Shake things up.
 
S7E5
It just fizzled.
hold tight
We just got bested.
How do we combat this guy?
I would like to stay. This pertains to me.
Well, that really bums me out.
Welcome aboard.
 
S7E4
How about we just chill out  a little bit on xxx.
There is no way I am gonna do that.
Track down xxx
Inform them of it.
It seems like you've done that on several occasions.
Are you gonna keep me in suspense?
There was a bit of a learning curve.
That's way too personal of a question.
self-deluded
How is that relevant to anything?
I'll let this slide.
You need to pick yourself up, man up!
 
S7E3
Let's just  knock this out right now.
There is a lot of gray area in that clause.
That would be permissible.
I appreciate the feedback.
You are in the hightlight.
 
S7E2
Let's take a tour.
We're gonna head outside.
A trained professional.
This is pointless.
I never said it out loud.
Make a definitive statement.
be in accordance with/be in compliance with
You forged them.
You had me so worked up that made a mistake.
Let's bang this out.
 
S7E1
Must have been some sort of mix-up there.
Nepotism
So many points being made.
This is hypothetical.
Back off
That's exactly what my first thought was.
I'm gonna hold you accountable for that.
You'er on the hook for this kid.
Can we talk in private?
What is this in reference to?
 
S6E26
Fix it up.
whistle-blower
I'm inclined to believe you.
Mop up
 
 
S6E25
You went too far.
I'll dig into those later.
Settle our dispute.
Do you have any idea the risks involved?
I'll have to take a rain check.
We delve into each other's personal lives?
Let's go check it out.
Try not to draw attention please.
Go for it.
My heart is still racing.
Was there a fist fight?
If you think that's going to have any effect on me
 
S6E24
 We're just clicking on every level.
Curl up with your favorite DVD.
Don't let your imagination run out of control.
My doctor told me to cut out hot dogs.
He was covering something up.
It's too late to undo it.
This thing is gonna spiral out of control.
 
 
S6E23
 I think we have complementary strengths.
I like the sound of this.
What if I back out.
boilerplate
 
S6E22
Why is everyone clumped around xxx?
break it up
She would be so psyched.
She really looks up to you.
This is an opportunity to show people I'm an authority figure.
Hello everyone, if might have a moment of your time.
I'm saying the exact opposite.
You have outdone yourself.
I have a very special connection to xxx.
take it up
To err is human.
It's tacky to xxx
 
S6E21
If you hear of anything going on, let me know.
Look, just be straight with me, man.
Ring her up.
You two hit it off.
You are off the hook.
A dash of razzle-dazzle.
You're really putting me in an awkward position here.
chill out
 
S6E20
Per se.
I'm filpping out.
I would like your undivided attention.
Don't gloat.
Money can corrupt people.
It's a conspiracy
Incentivize people.
I couldn't envy you more.
Well, that's not the way it's gonna sound.
stuck-up loser
Do you ever think of that?
I think we should hold our ground.
All those opposed raise you hand.
Way to go
 
S6E19
I sketched this out.
That's very generous of you, but I'm all set.
Is there something else I can help you with?
Unfortunately, I am stuck here because my boss is making us work late.
My future prospects at Amazon.
 
 
S6E17
I just feel a little bit frazzled.
Maybe we should take a break a little while.
This is debatable
 
S6E15
Due to the circumstances beyond my control,
To make sure everything is running smoothly.
I am trying to embrace all of these changes.
They ran away.
Pleased to meet you.
To be quite frank. Xxx
So we get a quick look around.
We just put it out in the open.
What are you guys up to?
team up with me
Pleasure to meet you
To piss off sb
 
S6E14
Nothing comes to mind.
I don't know how I'm going to get through this.
That's debatable.
Would you cut it out?
 
S6E13
My plan is on hold.
It is office camaraderie.
This is absurd.
We don't have to go through it again.
Busted.
Can you hop off?
They are going to clean house.
That is one suit I cannot fit into.
 
S6E12
Did you really look it over?
Xxx is still in existence.
fall victim to the system.
This encompasses all the data.
In ideal world.
Show of hands.
Online courses are a viable option.
Things are getting really bad down here.
I bumped you up.
 
S6E11
Just bullet points.
Could you condense it.
We are poised to come through this.
This is not as much fun as I though it would be.
Try to right the ship.
45 days to get us back on track.
You have dug us quite a hole.
The xxx thing I outlined, you go with that.
Just whatever comes to mind, shout it out.
Call in a little favor.
Come on in.
Extraordinaire
Take it away
Go down there, rattle off a few jokes.
Where is the off button on this moron?
Do I sometimes repeat a word to get point across?
 
S6E10
I want to stress xxxx
Things have not panned out on that front.
I only slack off when things are good.
We have congregated tonight
I reckon I will xxx
It is unprecedented.
It is cause for concern.
If I can be candid with you here, xxx
I can't really get my head around anything.
I gotta run.
He really stepped things up.
I renounce it.
 
S6E9
What does that add up to?
I think Xxx  is pretty much something I can rule out.
It just doesn't interest me.
Home run!
You set the bar so high.
Hey relax, I got it covered. I insist.
It took me a little around to come around.
 
S6E8
They put me up to it.
You just ignore their carping.
Anything out of bounds.
Can you kick me out  of this meeting?
Petite figure
Does that make you feel better?
Ill-defined type of thing
We thrilled.
I think you just gotta ride this one out, man.
It'll all go away.
Maybe we should go easy on xxx
I just got caught up in the fantasy.
It was fun to role-play.
I'm so sick of being single.
That will inevitably lead to xxx
 
S6E7
That is really thoughtful of you.
For our sakes, xxxx
Is it okay if I xxx
I think we should just drop it.
You should see where it goes.
That's messed up, man.
I think you're overreacting a little bit.
I want to apologize for taking that tone with you earlier.
in an instant
 
S6E6
Do you have any idea how valuable my time is?
Xxx raises some flags.
I should not be calling you.
That's an exaggeration.
When somebody threatens you, you give in right away.
They back for xxx.
The only way to defeat a bully is to stand up to him.
Let's hear him out.
shake down
You're stubborn.
I'd like to officially withdraw my plan.
I'm gonna back you up.
These are my associates.
I'm going to go ahead and put a hold on your card.
What's that supposed to mean?
I had to make a snap decision.
I didn't hear a thing you just said.
Dead end job.
I don't see that happening.
We surgically remove xxx.
That seems a little far-fetched.
He's trying to intimidate you.
per se
 
S6E5
I was trying  to liven things up a little bit.
I can offer you a complimentary breakfast.
I'm ravenous.
 
 
S6E4
Reservation for Fang Nan.
I'm afraid we're all sold out.
Pleased to meet you.
What am I supposed to do with that?
kick it up a notch.
You just need to chill out.
 
S6E3
Everyone, it is a good time to  fresh up.
Those meetings are disruptive.
Maybe we should talk specifics.
Well, to be fair, xxx
I think by the end, we all learned a little bit.
It's light out.
No offense.
I'm not bossing you around, I'm trying to do my job.
I'm very new at this.
I have good perspective on how things work.
It's hard to tell so far.
I've condensed what I've learned.
I know that this might come off as biased.
I think you are able to take constructive criticism very well.
Maybe I can bring something different to the table.
I have some tough news.
I'm just leveling with you.
I'm just trying to treat you like adults.
I'm just gonna rewind and back off a bit.
You cannot just keep avoiding us like this.
 
S6E2
I will send this off to xxx.
It just doesn't add up.
Bon appetit
 
S6E1
You can't back out now.
Just keep it to yourself.
I'm going to go break it off.
I'm counting on you.
I would resist.
The evidence is sort of stacked against me.
Step away.
This whole xx's thing's blown over.
 
S5E25
This is just a temporary setback.
Rest assured
Fellas, why don't we take a five minutes break? And then we will come back start fresh, sort this out.
Xxx sounds great!
 
S5E24
I'd just like to point out.
I just think bar should be lower for a newbie.
I am putting my food down ….
 
S5E23
Let's cut right to the chase.
Well, it was great catching up with you.
Are you happy with the things have been running lately?
Your concern is noted.
You see what I am saying.
You've been pestering me.
Be that as it may.
That is bummer.
That sounds like a fantastic idea.
 
S5E22
Make a list of things to do.
Don't patronize me.
It's just not how I operate.
Confidence is the food of wise man, but the liquor of the fool.
It was indescribable.
I have spent last 15 years learning the ins and outs of the xx industry.
How do you expect to turn a profit in this economy?
See, this is what concerns me.
I thought Nana raised some good questions.
I was just feeling impulsive.
I was gonna flunk out.
I thrive on this.
It's not the worst plan she's ever had.
 
S5E21
Have you really thought this through?
I am not giving up on it now.
We're in the middle of something.
You should be heading back to your desk.
In all climates.
It's a very intriguing concept.
What a courageous venture.
Put a pin in that.
I am at a crucial point.
I have sunk four hours into xxx.
It's just not prudent.
Michael is like a movie on a plan, it's not great but it's something to watch.
Day-to-day operations of the company
 
S5E20
I really think the two of you are gonna make a great team.
I'll give it my best shot.
Well, I'll just bounce that off David.
You wanna do some overtime this weekend?
I applaud your initiative.
That's not the way it's going to work.
This doesn't seem like a good way to spend company time.
I've put xxx on hold.
I will be in attendance.
 
S5E19
That is not constructive.
 
 
S5E18
No, I meant about xxxx.
I'm gonna soldier on a little bit.
 
S5E17
How about I make an appointment to come back?
Could I have a word with you?
We are keeping it pretty low key.
I am cordially inviting all of you.
Can I point something out to you?
 
S5E16
We are on the lam.
She is out of your league.
We just want to make it up to you.
Please cut it off.
I would like you all to give this shot.
I still think it's worthwhile.
Can I please see you in my office, please?
You let me down.
Thanks for walking me out.
I'm gonna be in touch with you.
Needless to say, xxx
I am going through something.
One step at a time.
Legs are sort of giving out.
I shouldn't have done it, I just couldn't help it.
 
 
S514
We are going to let it slide.
This is a very serious offense.
We have to strip you of your title as safety officer
It amuses me.
I am worried.
That's preposterous.
I have been a little abrupt with people.
How is that gonna help you?
xxx symbolizes xxx
He was pretty talkative.
He doesn't share with sb.
Do I stress you out?
They are catching things that are totally going over my head.
Her parents are going through a little bit of a rough patch in their marriage.
This all about moral.
It really went after my intelligence.
I jotted down xxx
Show up to work
Can you handle this job?
 
S512
Thanks for asking.
Back down
This none of your business
What a coincidence.
back off
 
S5E11
I wish you would take my side on this.
This is kind of a drag.
If we don't say anything, she is not gonna getting any better.
I just have to talk to you for a second.
That's considerate.
I can't take it anymore.
You know this can't go on.
You have to put an end to this.
Just bear in mind that xxx
You are not making any sense.
I am not very articulate.
 
S5E9
All in caps.
Thanks for asking.
Parcel those out.
Would you stop it?
What makes you think xxx
At some point xxx
How can we take pride in our jobs?
I am going to digest them and see what comes out.
I'll consider it.
Makin progress here.
You guys going to lunch, mind if I join
On the one hand
Neither of them are gonna concede.
 
S5E8
I am jetting off on an international business trip.
I have always been intrigued by xxx.
This trip really seemed to turn him around.
Just ask the concierge.
It is intoxicating.
Dude, leave us alone.
How could anyone stand that woman?
What do you see in her?
 
S5E7
Now get back to work.
Who stands to benefit from out downfall.
Can I tell you what else I learned?
I'm gonna take a big leap.
Why did you come to New York in the first place?
It's nuts to go back without getting to fully experience it.
 
 
S5E5
I think it goes without saying.
pump it up
With no future ado
I seriously doubt
 
 
S5E4
I think you need to step it up.
She is in the terminal stage of …
You don't have any idea what I've been through.
I can't hear you anything.
I am doing laundry for the first time in like a month.
We're just a little out of sync.
She's just on a coffee break.
Are you just a little off today?
I am headed home.
I ran out of money.
I just don't get it.
Leave all of this behind.
You need to give her ultimatum.
 
 
S5E3
Indistinguishable
I download pirated music onto my work computer.
That's a good place/time to end it.
They are really over the line.
We have to follow the protocol.
I'm just not happy about the way we're getting it.
Just let it go.
 
S5E2
The idea was to urge you to lose weight.
 
 
S5E1
I should really get going.
Do you think I'm retarded?
I'm trying to get some work done.
Could I have rain check?
It's great to see you.
I lost sight of myself.
You sabotaged me.
I was way out of line.
I want to make it up to you.
Can I call you back in a little bit?
 
S4E14
Would that be such a bad thing?
He tortured me.
We have been through this.
You can keep trying to push me out of this place.
I thought it was over the line.
Totally disregard that last voice mail.
Impossible to rise up.
I think you two have a lot to catch up on.
 
S4E13
A blank sheet of paper equals endless possibilities.
It has come to my attention.
Sorry for wasting your time.
Are you mental?
I'm not really looking to change thinkg up right now.
My fiscal year ends in two months.
Let me just get my last shot in there.
Is there anything you can do for me?
Hold on a sec,  I have to do something.
I am gonna wrap it up here. Thank you for your time, and drive safe.
Congratulations to you, Well done, nice job.
 
S4E12
You are moving in the wrong direction.
Stanley was openly insubordinate.
It's probably psychological.
goof around
I thrive on it.
Do you mind explaining it a little better?
Don't get all defensive.
 
S4E10
The website was infiltrated by sexual predators.
It has not been going well.
I am livid.
When will that be.
One stop consumer experience.
I am not applauding sarcastically.
I am so psyched you're here.
Look ahead into the future.
It is a lullaby.
 
S4E9
Make yourself to home.
Excuse me for a second.
 
S4E8
I'm feeling a little queasy.
They displayed a pattern of disrespect and inappropriate behaviors.
That is great to hear.
Can you describe the circumstances?
well put
Don't patronize me.
Before you go any further.
 
S4E7
I'm on it.
He possesses the skills.
Let's put it this way.
Shake things up a bit.
 
S4E6
You completely misinterpreted my tone.
Clearly, she is trying to get back at us.
It's very exclusive.
You monopolize  the conversation.
I'm going to cut right to the chase here.
I have no words.
So psyched.
Xx, hang on a second.
ultimately
 
S4E5
I let it slide.
It's a different skill set.
It's ready to air.
Do not take no for an answer.
Time out.
 
S4E4
We have gone through this.
Can I count on you?
I don't know why we have this conversation.
I hope this conversation has helped.
What is so captivating?
I'll look into that tomorrow.
Today we're going be talking about ….
He is not responding to my email
In my entire life.
I'm glad you enjoyed your stay.
How can you be so irresponsible.
This is astounding to me.
I just couldn't take it.
I'm really passionate about Italian food.
I really messed up.
 
S4E3
Let's quit (散会)
I'm singling you out.
Earthlings.
Be prone to
Why don't you just lay off
You know what. Why don't  you guys take off a little bit early tonight? 
I withdrew from consideration.
fix me up
Gotcha
It was kind of slap in the face.
I'm not gonna cry over it.
Accountability and follow-through
knock it off
I can back down
 
S4E2
He snapped me.
I would never take you for granted.
This is a massive overhaul.
That's the cut-off.
grim reaper
You are making great strides.
We are implementing a brand new system.
I was committed to …
Trying to squeeze out the older people.
I hope he gets hit with an ageism suit. 
We had to back off.
With respect to …
Today was a fantastic waste of time.
You should not resist it.
This is the way the world is moving.
I gave this everything I could
That was really nice of you to say.
That is a very good point.
bear right
We will take a stand
meteoric rise
 
S4E1
You are downer.
How could you do that without telling me?
You look cute as button
back off me
It's not about winning, it's about finishing
By afflicted by ….
Everybody, listen up.
So hands off
I don't what this to detract
I'm in grief.
She is now deceased
I'm petrified of ….
Back in olden time
That is for a good cause.
You gotta step it up.
Jan pledged $500.
how could get any worse?
laugh it off
I was planning on it.

No offence
I need to refresh my memory
out of curiosity

You just have to push through it sometimes.
You really shouldn’t litter.
I am so angry over all of this.
It’s demeaning.
It will blow over.
this is spinning out of control
a gesture of gratitude
She has a good point.
well, that’s debatable
she might be bluffing

nothing more nothing less
This will help you to relax, it will help you to relieve some of the tension and axiety

What does my job entail?
People’s lives are at stake.
I deserve a bump.
It’s infuriating.
I just can’t grab onto him.
What’s your angle?
That is the way these things are done.
You make a very compelling argument.
That’s a very good point.
I think I should be compensated fairly.
Let’s get down to business.
I’d like that to be moved up to now.
You must’ve been scared out your mind.
crime of passion
you’re gonna suck it up
all in all
tear the contract up into a million pieces.
How have you adapted your business model to function in an increasingly paperless world.
Their customers are dying off
xx can’t compete with xxx
without further ado
You need to step up and show some leadership 
It doesn’t apply
call it off
I lost my train of thought
It is rational to do xxx
aim at
keep the wheels on
bump up
I lose my appetite
things got a little out of hand

Jim and I have had a little bit of a rough patch
from now on
I’m not really that well versed with the technology/tool.
good to have you back
that’ll lift everyone’s spirits
That dream was shattered.
It’s been a pleasure working with you.
It didn’t amount to anything.
He was hung up on Pam for such a long time.
It’s really a pleasure to be a part of it
Nothing would delight me more
